@model IndexModel  // indicates the class name of the page model

}

@* The web page is made up of two major different components
    a) the layout page located in the folder /Pages/Shared as a file called _Layout
    b) the content page

    The content Page should be placed in the /pages folder
    The content page(s) can be placed in a subfolder(s) under the /Pages folder
    The content page is made up of 2 components in seperate files 
        a)xxx.cshtml file - contains the html controls and display c# logic
        b)xxx.cshtml.cs file - this is the PageModel file class file 
                                this contains the logic to drive the webpage
                                this does not contain any HTML controls
                                this does contain properties for the model class 
                                    to transfer data between your web controls 
                                    and the model class properties.
                                this file is sometimes refered to as "code-behind"
